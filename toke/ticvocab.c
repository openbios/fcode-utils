/* **************************************************************************
 *
 *      We are going to implement a strategy that takes better advantage
 *          of the concept of Threaded Interpretive Code  (well, okay,
 *          it won't really be interpretive ... )  We will use it to
 *          implement a small (but expandable) subset of FORTH-like
 *          commands in Tokenizer-Escape mode, as well as a few other
 *          things, such as conditional-tokenization.
 *
 *      The Threaded Interpretive Code Header data structure is described
 *          in detail in the accompanying  ticvocab.h  header-file.
 *
 *      In most cases, the contents of a beginning portion of the vocabulary
 *          are known at compile-time, and later parts are added by the
 *          user at run-time.  (The linked-list structure is needed to allow
 *          for that.)  We can initialize the known start of the vocabulary
 *          easily, except for the link-pointers, as an array.
 *      We can either explicitly state an index for each entry's link-pointer
 *          to the previous entry (which can become a problem to maintain) or
 *          have a function to initialize the links dynamically, at run-time.
 *      I think I will (regretfully, resignedly) choose the latter.
 *          
 *      We will define a few general-purpose functions for dealing with
 *          T. I. C. -type vocabularies.  Eventually, it might be a good
 *          idea to convert all the vocabularies to this structure...

 *              entry's param-field memory space will not be freed with
 *              the alias-entry but only with the "old" entry.
 *          We will do both the "Creation-Tracing" announcement and the
 *              Duplicate Name Warning here.  "Tracing" happens either if
 *              the entry for the old name has its  tracing  flag set, or

 *             For the new entry, by the support routine.
 *         When Freed?
 *             When reset_tic_vocab() is applied to the same vocab-list.

 *      Process Explanation:
 *          The given vocabulary is both the "Source" and the "Destination".
 *              Pass them both to  create_split_alias.
