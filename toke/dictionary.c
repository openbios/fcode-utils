 *      Revision History:
 *          Updated Fri, 29 Jul 2005 by David L. Paktor
 *          Retrofit to handle "Current Device" as a separate vocabulary;
 *              if one is in effect, searches through it occur first, as
 *              do definitions to it, ahead of the general vocabulary.  This
 *              is to support managing device-node vocabularies correctly.
 *          Updated Mon, 12 Dec 2005 by David L. Paktor
 *          Allow the user to specify a group of exceptions, words whose
 *              scope will be "global" within the tokenization.  Under "global"
 *              scope, definitions will be made to the "core" vocabulary.
 *
 *          Wed, 14 Dec 2005 by David L. Paktor
 *          Found a problem with the current approach.  Need to be able to
 *              temporarily suspend meaning of "instance".  Define:  (1) an
 *              alias for  INSTANCE  called  GENERIC_INSTANCE  (2) a macro
 *              called  INSTANCE  that effectively no-ops it out; and, when
 *              it is time to restore "INSTANCE" to normal functionality,
 *              (3) an alias for  GENERIC_INSTANCE  called  INSTANCE .
 *          Problem is that macros are treated as a separate vocabulary
 *              from FWords (and their aliases) and searching one before the
 *              other (either way) renders the second one searched unable to
 *              supercede the first one:  If macros are searched first, (2)
 *              will be found ahead of the built-in FWord (which is what we
 *              want) but later, when we search for (3) among the FWords, it
 *              will not be found ahead of (2).  If, on the other hand, we
 *              search FWords first, the macro defined in (2) will never be
 *              found.
 *          We need a way to define both (all?) types of definitions in a
 *              single vocabulary that will honor the LIFO order of def'ns.
 *
 *          Mon, 19 Dec 2005 by David L. Paktor
 *          Begin development of implementation of a way to define both (all?)
 *              types of definitions in a single  tic_hdr_t  type vocabulary.

 *          Issue a message when a name on the trace list is invoked (as well
 *              as when it is created), but keep a limit on the speed penalty.
 *              (I.e., don't scan the trace-list for every symbol invoked.)
 *              We will scan the trace-list for every pre-defined symbol during
 *              initialization of the built-in vocabularies' lists, but that
 *              occurs only once...

/* **************************************************************************
 *
 *      We will be creating several different lists of initial built-in
 *          definitions; together, they constitute the Global Vocabulary.
 *          (We will avoid the term "dictionary", since, in classical
 *          Forth terminology, it refers to the complete collection of
 *          vocabularies in an application.)  The usage of the pointer
 *          to the Global Vocabulary is central to the operation of this
 *          program and the maintenance programmer needs to understand it.
 *          We may also refer to the Global Vocabulary as the "core" vocab.
 *
 *      Each initial list will be created as an array of TIC-header entries.
 *          Because the global vocabulary is expandable by the user,
 *          we will not be searching the lists as arrays but rather as
 *          linked-lists; the run-time initialization routine will fill
 *          in their link-fields and also will link the various lists
 *          together, so we can group their initial declarations according
 *          to our convenience.
 *
 *      A single pointer, called the "Global Vocabulary Dictionary Pointer"
 *          (okay, so classical Forth terminology isn't completely rigorous...)
 *          and abbreviated GV_DP, will point to the "tail" of the "thread".
 *          Similar vocabularies will be created for the device-nodes; look
 *          in the file  devnode.fth  for a more detailed discussion of those.
 *
 *      The "FC-Tokens" list contains the names and FCode numeric tokens
 *          of the straightforward FORTH words that simply write a token
 *          directly to the tokenized output.  We need to access these
 *          without being confused by aliases or other distractions, so
 *          we will keep a pointer to them especially for that purpose.
 *      Therefore it is IMPORTANT:  that the "FC-Tokens" list MUST be the
 *          first table linked by the initialization routine, so that its
 *          last-searched entry's link-field is NULL.
 *
 *      The "FWords" list contains FORTH words that require additional
 *          special action at tokenization-time.  Their numeric values
 *          are derived from the  fword_token  enumeration declaration,
 *          and are used as the control-expression for a SWITCH statement
 *          with a large number of CASE labels in the  handle_internal()
 *          function.
 *
 *      The "Shared Words" list contains FORTH words that can be executed
 *          similarly both during "Tokenizer Escape" mode (i.e., the scope
 *          of the special brackets:  tokenizer[  ...   ]tokenizer ) and
 *          also within "Normal Tokenization" mode.  Their numeric values
 *          are derived and used the same way as the "FWords".  Since we
 *          will be needing to do a separate search through them at times,
 *          we will also need a lower-bracket pointer for them.  (An upper
 *          bracket is irrelevant for these, because aliases can be added.
 *          This is not the case for the "FC-Tokens" list, because searches
 *          through those will be conducted from within this program.)
 *
 *      The "definer" field in the TIC-header structure is primarily used to
 *          detect attempts to apply the  TO  directive to an inappropriate
 *          target.  Its numeric values are a subset of the "FWord tokens".
 *          Certain "FC-Token" names are specified to be valid  TO  targets;
 *          their entries' "definer" fields will be initialized accordingly.
 *          Entries in FWord Token lists that are "shared" between "Normal
 *          Tokenization" and "Tokenizer Escape" modes will have their
 *          "definer" fields initialized to  COMMON_FWORD .  All other
 *          entries' "definer" fields will be initialized to  UNSPECIFIED .
 *
 *      Other files maintain and support additional lists with the same
 *          structure, which need to be linked together with the lists
 *          declared here.  We prefer to keep the  GV_DP  private to this
 *          file, so it will be passed as a parameter where needed.  (I'm
 *          not pleased to note, however, that it can't be kept completely
 *          private; it's needed for add_user_macro() and possibly other
 *          functions outside this file.)
 *
 *      The words that can only be used during "Tokenizer Escape" mode and
 *          the IBM-style "Locals", as well as the device-node vocabularies,
 *          will need to be separate and will not be linked together with
 *          the Global Vocabulary.

 *      In order to protect device-nodes' methods from being accessed

 *          Searches for names go through the "current" device-node's

 *          vocabulary.  The node that had been current (presumably its
 *          parent) remains in memory but inactive.
 *
 *      A finish-device (again, only in interpretation-mode) removes the
 *          current device-node's vocabulary from memory; its presumed
 *          parent once again becomes current.
 *
 *      Tokenization starts with an implicit "new-device" in effect.
 *          The top-level device-node is never removed.
 *
 *      The Global Variable  current_definitions  points to the vocabulary
 *          to which we will add and through which we will search first.

 *         Printout:
 *             Advisory message if Rule 3 (see below) is invoked.
 *
 *      Process Explanation:
 *          Both the "old" and "new" names are presumed to already point to
 *              stable, freshly allocated memory-spaces.
 *          Rules:
 *          (1)
 *          If "global" scope is in effect, and the "old" name is found in
 *              the Global Vocabulary, then the "new" name will be created
 *              in the Global Vocabulary.
 *          (2)
 *          Similarly, if "device" scope is in effect, and the "old" name is
 *              found in the current device-node's vocabulary, the "new" name
 *              will be created in the current device-node's vocabulary.
 *          (3)
 *          BUT!:  If "device" scope is in effect, and the "old" name is found
 *              in the Global Vocabulary, then the "new" name will be created
 *              in the current device-node's vocabulary.  It will only be
 *              recognized in the scope of that device-node, and will be
 *              removed from memory when the device-node is "finish"ed.
 *          And, yes, it *is* supposed to work that way...   ;-)
 *
 *          Again, because  current_definitions  points to the Global Vocab
 *              pointer during "global" scope, the first two rules of this
 *              routine are extremely straightforward; it's Rule 3 that you
 *              have to watch out for...  ;-)
 *
 *          And one other thing:
 *              We will always make the alias's  pfld_size  zero.  See the
 *              prolog for  create_split_alias()  in  ticvocab.c  for details...
 *
 *      Extraneous Remarks:
 *          I tried stretching the rules of well-structured code, but
 *              I'm finding that there is a _good_reason_ for them...

/* **************************************************************************
 *
 *      Function name:  emit_token
 *      Synopsis:       Emit the FCode token for the given FCode name.
 *
 *      Inputs:
 *         Parameters:
 *             fc_name                     The name of the FCode
 *         Local Static Variables:
 *             fc_tokens_list_start        "Tail" of the "FC-Tokens" list
 *
 *      Outputs:
 *         Returned Value:                 NONE
 *
 *      Error Detection:
 *          This routine should only be called with hard-coded names from
 *              within the program.  If the given name is not found in
 *              the Built-in Tokens Table, that is a FATAL error.
 *
 *      Process Explanation:
 *          Because the "FCode-Tokens" table was linked first, and the
 *              pointer kept for this purpose, the "FC-Tokens" list can
 *              be a subset of the "core" list, yet, when necessary, can

 *
 *      Process Explanation:
 *          We cannot rely on the "definer" field to indicate whether
 *              it is a single-token entry, and there too many possible
 *              associated functions to be practical; instead we will
 *              look at the  is_token  flag of the data structure.
 *
 *      Revision History:
 *          Updated Mon, 25 Sep 2006 by David L. Paktor
 *              Previously operated by examining the function associated
 *                  with the entry, accepting the general single-token
 *                  emitting function,  FC_TOKEN_FUNC , and later adding
 *                  the function  OBSO_FC_FUNC , which presents a message
 *                  before emitting.  Now the functions that present a
 *                  message before emitting might be about to proliferate,
 *                  rendering this implementation strategy impractical (i.e.,
 *                  ugly to code and too attention-demanding to maintain)
 *                  Instead, I will introduce a flag into the TIC-entry 
 *                  data-structure and rely on it.
 *          Updated Wed, 11 Oct 2006 by David L. Paktor
 *              Discarded plan to have functions that present a "Trace-Note"
 *                  message prior to performing their other duties (just too
 *                  unwieldly all around) in favor of adding a "tracing" flag
 *                  to the TIC_HDR data-structure.  Could have gone back to
 *                  doing this the other way, but this is so much neater a
 *                  solution that I'm keeping it.
