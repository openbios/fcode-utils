 *          Replace the FUNCT field of the Macro entry with the Macro

 *          Suspend multi-line warning; see comment in body of add_user_macro()
 *              The multi-line warning flag is kept by  push_source()
 *
 *      Still to be done:

 *              Do not process Macros (or, for that matter, User-defined

 *                  (etc.) might contain a phrase (such as the start of

 *                  body of a file, thus causing an undeserved Error.
 *                  Instead, they need to be handled in a more sophis-

 *                  perhaps, that will make a smooth transition between

 *     In order to integrate Recursion Error Detection with the smooth

 *         normal behavior of the macro after it's completed, by re-
 *         instating the address of the normal Macro-invocation routine;
 *         that routine, of course, is the one that passes the address
 *         of the "resumption" routine to push_source().  In order to
 *         get around this chicken-and-egg dilemma, we will create a
 *         local static variable into which the address of the normal
 *         Macro-invocation routine will be stored.  We actually only
 *         need it once, but we'd rather avoid the overhead of checking,
 *         every time, whether it has already been set; since it's always
 *         the same, there's no harm in storing it every time.

 *              we will issue the Error Message for either condition.
 *          Check if the Macro name is a duplicate; warn_if_duplicate()
 *              routine will issue message.
 *
 *      Process Explanation:
 *          We start just after the directive has been recognized.
 *          Get one word in line -- this is the macro name
 *          Get input to end of line.  This is the "body" of the macro.
 *          Add the Macro to the Current vocab, using support routine.
 *          Set the definer field to MACRO_DEF and the Function to the
 *              same one that's used for the built-in macros.
 *          User-defined Macros may need to be processed while ignoring
 *              (because they might include conditional-operators, etc.)
 *              We will set the ign_func the same as the active function.
 *
 *      To be considered:
 *          Do we want to do further filtration? 
 *              Remove comments?
 *              Compress whitespace?
 *              Allow backslash at end of line to continue to next line?
 *
 *      Extraneous Remarks:

 *              as all other definition types:  if Device-Definitions are
 *              in effect, the scope of the new Macro definition will be

 *             statbuf            Word currently being processed.
 *
 *      Outputs:
 *         Returned Value:        NONE
 *
 *      Error Detection:
 *          At least two words in the input stream are expected to be on
 *              the same line as the user-Macro definer, same as when the
 *              directives occurs in a segment that is not being Ignored.
 *              The  get_word_in_line()  and  get_rest_of_line()  routines
 *              will check for condition., we will issue the Error Message.
 *
 *      Process Explanation:
 *          We need to protect against the case of a macro-definition that
 *              invokes a directive that alters Conditional processing...
