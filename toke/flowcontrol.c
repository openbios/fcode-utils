 *      Still to be done:
 *          Correct analysis of Return-Stack usage around Flow-Control
 *              constructs, including within Do-Loops or before Loop
 *              Elements like I and J or UNLOOP or LEAVE.
 *          Similarly, Return-Stack usage around IF ... ELSE ... THEN
 *              statements needs analysis.  For instance, the following:
 * 
 *          blablabla >R  yadayada IF  R> gubble ELSE flubble R>  THEN
 * 
 *              is, in fact, correct, while something like:
 * 
 *          blablabla >R  yadayada IF  R> gubble THEN
 * 
 *              is an error.
 * 
 *          Implementing an analysis that would be sufficiently accurate
 *              to justify reporting an ERROR with certainty (rather than
 *              a mere WARNING speculatively) would probably require full
 *              coordination with management of Flow-Control constructs,

 *
 *     Control-Structure identification, matching, completion and error
 *         messaging will be supported by a data structure, which we
 *         will call a CSTAG-Group
 *
 *     It consists of one "Data-item" and several "Marker" items, thus:
 *
 *         The Data-item in most cases will be a value of OPC (the Output
 *             Buffer Position Counter) which will be used in calculating 
 *             an offset or placing an offset or both, as the case may be,
 *             for the control structure in question.  The one exception
 *             is for a CSTAG-Group generated by a CASE statement; its
 *             Data-item will be an integer count of the number of "OF"s
 *             to be resolved when the ENDCASE statement is reached.
 *
 *         The CSTAG for the FORTH word, as described above
 *         The name of the input file in which the word was encountered
 *             (actually, a pointer to a mem-alloc'ed copy of the filename)
 *         The line number, within the input file, of the word's invocation
 *         The Absolute Token Number in all Source Input of the word
 *         The FORTH word that started the structure, (used in error messages)
 *         A flag to indicate when two CSTAG-Groups are created together,
 *             which will be used to prevent duplicate error messages when,
 *             for instance, a  DO  is mismatched with a  REPEAT .
 *
 **************************************************************************** */

/* **************************************************************************
 *
 *               "Control-Stack" Diagram Notation
 *
 *     The CSTAG-Groups will be kept in an order resembling a data-stack,
 *         (even though it won't be the data-stack itself).  We will refer
 *         to this list of structures as the "Control Stack", and in our
 *         comments we will show their arrangement in a format resembling
 *         stack-diagram remarks.
 *
 *     In these "Control-Stack Diagrams", we will use the notation:
 *		   <Stmt>_{FOR|BACK}w_<TAGNAM>
 *         to represent a CSTAG-Group generated by a <Stmt> -type of
 *         statement, with a "FORw"ard or "BACKw"ard branch-marker and
 *         a CSTAG of the <TAGNAM> type.
 *
 *     A CASE-CSTAG-Group will have a different notation:
 *		   N_OFs...CASE_CSTAG
 *
 *     In all cases, a CSTAG-Group will be manipulated as a unit.
 *
 *     The notation for Control-Stack Diagram remarks will largely resemble
 *         the classic form used in FORTH, i.e., enclosed in parentheses,
 *         lowest item to the left, top item on the right, with a double-
 *         hyphen to indicate "before" or "after".
 *
 *     Enclosure in {curly-braces} followed by a subscript-range indicates
 *         that the Stack-item or Group is repeated.
 *
 **************************************************************************** */

/* **************************************************************************
 *
 *      We are not keeping the "Control Stack" structures on the regular
 *          data stack because a sneaky combination of user-inputs could
 *          throw things into chaos were we to use that scheme.  Consider
 *          what would happen if a number were put on the stack, say, in
 *          tokenizer-escape mode, in between elements of a flow-control
 *          structure...  Theoretically, there is no reason to prohibit
 *          that, but it would be unexpectedly problematical for most
 *          FORTH-based tokenizers.
 *
 *      Maintaining the "Control Stack" structures in a linked-list would
 *          be a more nearly bullet-proof approach.  The theory of operation
 *          would be the same, broadly speaking, and there would be no need
 *          to check for  NOT_CSTAG  and no risk of getting the elements of
 *          the control-structures out of sync.

 *                      If no error, pass the Data-item back to the caller.
 *                      Do not consume the CSTAG-Group; that will be the

 *
 *      Inputs:

 *
 *      Error Detection:
 *           Control Stack underflow or cstag mismatch.  See below for details.
 *
 *      Process Explanation:
 *           If the expected cstag does not match the cs_tag from the CSTAG
 *               Group on "Top" of the "Control Stack", print an ERROR message,
 *               and, unless the "Ignore Errors" flag is in effect, prepare
 *               to return FALSE.
 *          However, if we've "underflowed" the "Control Stack", we dare not
 *              ignore errors; that could lead to things like attempting to
 *              write a forward-branch FCode-offset to offset ZERO, over the
 *              FCODE- or PCI- -header block.  We don't want that...
 *          So, if the  control_stack  pointer is NULL, we will print an
 *              ERROR message and immediately return FALSE.
 *          Since we will not consume the CSTAG-Group, the calling routine
 *              can access the Data-Item and any "Marker" information it may
 *              still require via the local  control_stack  pointer. The caller
 *              will be responsible for removing the CSTAG-Group.
 *
 *      Special Exception to "Ignore Errors":
 *          At the last usage of the  CASE_CSTAG , for the ENDCASE statement,
 *              this routine will be called to control freeing-up memory, etc.
 *          For the OF statement, it will be called to control incrementing
 *              the OF-count datum.
 *          Processing an ENDCASE statement with the datum from any other
 *              CSTAG-Group can lead to a huge loop.
 *          Processing any other "resolver" with the datum from an ENDCASE
 *              CSTAG-Group can lead to mistaking a very low number for an
 *              offset into the Output Buffer and attempting to write to it.
 *          Incrementing the datum from any other CSTAG-Group can lead to
 *              a variety of unacceptable errors, too many to guess.
 *          So, if either the given cstag or the cs_tag field of the "Top"
 *              CSTAG-Group is a CASE_CSTAG , we will not ignore errors.

 *
 *      Extraneous Remarks:
 *          Before control-structure identification was implemented, offsets
 *              were kept on the data-stack, and this was a single SWAP.
 *          When CSTAGs were added, the "Group" was only a pair kept on the
 *               data-stack -- the CSTAG and the Data-item -- and this
 *               became a TWO_SWAP()
 *          For a while, when I tried keeping the CSTAG-Group on the stack,
 *               this became a FOUR_SWAP()
 *          That turned out to be unacceptably brittle; this way is much
 *               more robust. 
 *          I am so glad I called this functionality out into a separate

 *              but our other error-reporting mechanisms will catch it,
 *              so we don't check or report it here.
 *
 *      Process Explanation:
 *          Just before this function is called, the backward-branching
 *              token for the "LOOP" variant that ends the control-structure
 *              was written to the FCode Output buffer.
 *          It needs an FCode-offset for a backward-branch targeted just
 *              after its corresponding "DO" variant and the FCode-offset
 *              associated therewith.
 *          That "DO" variant's associated FCode-offset is targeted to
 *              the token that follows the one for this "LOOP" variant
 *              and its FCode-offset.
 *          Make sure there are two DO C-S Tag entries on the Control Stack.
 *          Resolve the backward-branch, matching your target to the first
 *              C-S Tag for DO
 *          Then resolve the forward-branch, targeting to your new OPC
 *              position, and also making sure you match the DO C-S Tag.
 *          We keep track of  do_loop_depth  for other error-detection
 *              by decrementing it; make sure it doesn't go below zero.
 *          Don't bother resolving the forward-branch if we underflowed
 *              the "Control Stack" trying to resolve the backward-branch.
 *          If the two top C-S Tag entries are not for a DO statement, the
 *              matchup_two_control_structures() routine will consume both
 *              or up to two of them, and we will place a dummy offset of

 *              already been written.

 *         Memory Freed
 *             By called routine.
 *
 *      Error Detection:
 *          Any item on the "Control-Stack" represents a Control-Structure
 *              that was not completed when the Calling Condition was
 *              encountered.  Error; identify the origin of the structure.
 *          No special actions if  noerrors  is set.
 *
 *      Process Explanation:
 *          The given limit corresponds to the value of  abs_token_no  at
 *              the time the colon-definition (or whatever...) was created.
 *              Any kind of Control-Structure imbalance at the end of the
 *              colon-definition is an error and the entries must be cleared,
 *              but the colon-definition may have been created inside nested
 *              interpretation-time Control-Structures, and those must be
 *              preserved. 
 *             
 *          Of course, if this routine is called with a given limit of zero,
 *              that would mean all the entries are to be cleared.  That will
 *              be the way  clear_control_structs()  is implemented.
 *          We control the loop by the  cs_abs_token_num  field, but also
 *              make sure we haven't underflowed  control_stack_depth
 *          We skip messages and other processing for items that are duplicates
 *                    of others, based on the  cs_not_dup  field.
 *               If the cs_tag field is  DO_CSTAG  we decrement  do_loop_depth
 *          The  pop_cstag()  routine takes care of the rest.
 *               
 *      Extraneous Remarks:
 *          This is a retrofit; necessary because we now  permit definitions
 *              to occur inside interpretation-time Control-Structures.  Calls
 *              to  clear_control_structs()  are already scattered around...
