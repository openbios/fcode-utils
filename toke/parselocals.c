 *             bufr            The buffer into which to place it.
 *                                 Needn't be very long:

 *          Convert into decimal.  If the number is greater than 8,
 *              prepend a  d#  in front of it.  If less, don't.

 *              The eval_string() routine no longer calls its own
 *                  instance of  tokenize() .  In order to make a
 *                  smooth transition between the processing the
 *                  internally-generated string and the resumption
 *                  of processing the source file, it simply sets
 *                  up the string to be processed next.
 *              In this case, however, we need to have the string
 *                  processed right away, as the calling routine
 *                  emits a token that must follow those generated
 *                  by this.
 *              Fortunately, we know the exact contents of the string.
 *                  Two calls to tokenize_one_word() will satisfy the
 *                  requirement.
