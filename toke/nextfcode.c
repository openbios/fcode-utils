/* **************************************************************************
 *
 *      The fact that the user is able to specify, at any time, the
 *          next FCode number to be assigned introduces the risk that
 *          a symbol might inadvertently be assigned an FCode that is
 *          still in use by another symbol, which could lead to bizarre
 *          and hard-to-trace failures at run-time.
 *
 *      This module will support a means whereby to detect and report,
 *          as an Error, overlapping FCode assignments.
 *
 *      The task is further complicated by the fact that, under some
 *          circumstances, "recycling" a range of FCodes can be done
 *          safely, and the programmer may do so intentionally.
 *
 *      We will define a way for the programmer to specify that FCode
 *          assignments are being intentionally "recycled", and that
 *          overlaps with previously-assigned FCodes are not to be
 *          treated as Errors.  We will not attempt to analyze whether
 *          it is, indeed, safe to do so; the programmer who does this
 *          is presumed to be sufficiently responsible.

 *          If no Ranges exist yet, and the new starting FCode is equal to
 *              the current value of  nextfcode , this is a continuation of
 *              the first and only range; do not change the file name or line
 *              number; just go away.
 *          If no Ranges exist yet, and no FCode assignments have been made
 *              in the current range, then this is a new start for the first
 *              and only range; detect the latter condition by range_end == 0
 *              Call the  reset_fcode_ranges()  routine to update the file name
 *              and line number, then update the remaining variables for the
 *              current (first and only) range, and you are done here.
 *          If no Ranges exist yet, and if FCode assignments _have_ been made
 *              in the current (first and only) range, create a data structure
 *              for the first (and now no longer only) Range and point both
 *              the  first_fc_range  and  current_fc_range  pointers at it.
 *              Set the  ranges_exist  flag to TRUE.
 *          If Ranges exist, whether from being newly-created, above, or from
 *              earlier, create a data structure for the new Current Range
 *              and move the  current_fc_range  pointer to point at it.  If
 *              the new starting FCode is equal to  nextfcode  we still want
 *              to create a new Range that will be listed separately.
 *          If no assignments were made within the Current Range, we will not
 *              overwrite or delete it; it will be listed at the appropriate
 *              time, and will be harmless in the overlap test.
 *
 *      Extraneous Remarks:
 *          We will trade off the strict rules of structured code here,
 *              in exchange for ease of coding.
